# Prepare and run a release workflow

Load after the [package contract](github-packaging.md) is sufficient, or when inspecting/dispatching an established release workflow. **sdd-manage** coordinates repository authoring, verification and Git persistence. **sdd-forge** owns requested GitHub dispatch/monitoring; it does not commit or push the workflow files.

## Author or extend

Inspect existing `.github/workflows/` and project build procedures. Reuse a suitable workflow and publishing stage rather than introduce competing release creators. Establish trigger, exact source/tag inputs, build-only versus publication behavior, supported variants, expected asset set and notes/latest/prerelease policy. Keep a simple source ZIP proportionate: an explicit inventory, relevant checks, archive inspection, checksum and one publishing stage may be enough.

Generated workflows must:

- Select the exact release source. For tag triggers, use the tag's resolved commit; for manual runs, distinguish the ref containing the workflow from the release source input. Resolve and verify tag/version agreement before publication. Never silently build a moving default branch for a selected release tag.
- Support the accepted tag trigger and/or `workflow_dispatch`, plus build-only validation where needed. A manual dispatch requires the workflow to be present on the default branch and to declare `workflow_dispatch`; verify the selected ref contains the intended workflow. Inspect actual inputs rather than assume their names.
- Use declared runtimes/dependencies and supported actions. Pass user inputs as data through environment/structured arguments rather than interpolate arbitrary text into shell code. Run the meaningful project checks and the agreed package inspection against actual built archives.
- Scope job permissions: build jobs normally need Contents read; the publisher needs Contents write for release writes. PAT Workflows permission enables workflow-file modification; conditional Actions permission enables provider dispatch/run operations. These are separate from job `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions. Keep credentials out of outputs and package inventories.
- Build every required variant, check nonempty outputs and unique names, collect the exact asset set and create SHA-256 files. For a matrix, collect all successful builds before one publisher creates/uploads/publishes the release. Do not upload an unexamined broad glob or silently omit a failed variant.
- Serialize publication for the same repository/tag with an appropriate concurrency group. Avoid cancellation that abandons uploads or races between tag and manual triggers. Define repeat behavior using the [release lifecycle](github-releases.md), not unconditional `gh release create` or `--clobber`.
- Keep build-only runs free of tag/release writes. Record build outputs separately from public release assets. Optional signing, SBOM or provenance steps follow actual project requirements.

A tag pushed with the repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not normally trigger another push workflow. Follow [GitHub's token event rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/github_token): build/publish in the same intended workflow or use a supported dispatch route; do not claim the chain ran without evidence. Do not change accounts/tokens to evade a host denial.

Verify syntax with suitable tooling, inspect permissions/inputs/checkout identity and execute the local build/verification where supported. Use [release checks](../../sdd-verify/references/release-checks.md). Distinguish a parsed YAML file, successful local package build, actual CI run and hosted release verification. GitHub Actions syntax and runtime compatibility are not proved merely by YAML parsing.

## Notes transfer

Use [shared Git highlights](release-highlights.md) to prepare/update curated notes through the exact intended source before dispatch or a publishing tag push. Select the previous baseline before creating the pending release tag, or explicitly exclude that tag; retries retain the validated prior baseline. Complete semantic editing on the agent side. An ignored local draft is absent from checkout, and ordinary Actions runners do not implicitly supply an AI agent. If a workflow collects Git evidence itself, establish complete tags/history (a default shallow checkout is insufficient), but deterministic log collection is not semantic distillation.

Inspect the existing publisher’s declared mechanism. For manual dispatch, a declared string notes input can carry the finalized Markdown via a supported structured/JSON input file; the publishing job must consume that value as data through a notes file/API body, not shell interpolation. Check input size limits and preserve multiline bytes. For larger notes or tag-only workflows, establish an authorized source-associated artifact/file transfer with explicit retrieval and integrity/identity checks; never assume the ignored draft was pushed. Keep YAML control data out of the final body. Do not add an untrusted arbitrary download/execute mechanism.

If the existing workflow has no supported notes transfer, extend and verify it before triggering publication or return the prepared handoff as pending. Generated notes alone do not satisfy requested curated highlights. Reuse one publisher, preserve human notes, avoid duplicate highlights and retain the local draft until published-body readback confirms consumption. Build-only or failed runs retain it.

## Dispatch and monitor

Dispatch only when the request covers running the selected workflow and its effects. Resolve repository, workflow ID/path, selected ref, actual inputs, exact intended release source and expected outputs. Check [operation-specific access](github.md#release-and-workflow-access); Workflows write does not imply Actions write. Do not enable a disabled workflow or change repository settings by implication.

For a configured workflow, a command recipe is:

```text
gh workflow run release.yml --repo OWNER/REPO --ref WORKFLOW_REF -f tag=RELEASE_TAG -f publish=false
```

Replace those example input names with the workflow's declared inputs. `publish=false` is meaningful only if the workflow implements that build-only behavior. Change it to publication only when the selected request covers that operation. Use structured inputs or a JSON input file for complex values. See [GitHub CLI dispatch](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_workflow_run) and the [workflow REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflows).

Retain a returned run ID/URL when available. Where a client/API returns only dispatch acceptance, correlate the run using workflow/ref/event/time and any declared request marker; do not pick the most recent unrelated run. After an uncertain dispatch, inspect existing runs before repeating. Ambiguous correlation remains unknown and blocks a duplicate dispatch.

Inspect queued/running/completed state, conclusion and the expected jobs/artifacts. Use `gh run view RUN_ID --repo OWNER/REPO` or the supported run API; bounded monitoring may return pending with the known run URL and next action. Do not wait indefinitely or infer build success from dispatch acceptance. No automatic rerun/cancel is implied by a failure.

When the workflow owns publication, do not create the same release independently. After successful publication, apply [release readback](github-releases.md#read-back-and-report). Return workflow/ref/source, run identity and conclusion, actual outputs, release state, failures and pending work. A failed job or unavailable facility keeps its affected result unverified.
